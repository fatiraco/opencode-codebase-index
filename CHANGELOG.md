# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Subsystem module splits**: Split large config, embeddings, eval, MCP, watcher, git, tools, routing, and utility modules into smaller focused files while preserving public entrypoints (#92).
- **AI slop removal**: Trimmed redundant comments and small wrapper noise across config, eval, runtime, indexer, tools, and utils with behavior-neutral refactors (#93).

- **Remove SiliconFlow default**: The custom reranker no longer falls back to a Chinese endpoint (`api.siliconflow.cn`). A `baseUrl` is now required for the `custom` reranker provider. README examples updated to use Cohere and generic env-var placeholders.
### Fixed
- **SSRF protection for custom embedding provider**: Custom provider URLs are now validated against cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.x.x, metadata.google.internal) and non-HTTP protocols to prevent server-side request forgery via malicious config files.
- **Knowledge base path restrictions**: `add_knowledge_base` now blocks sensitive system directories (`/etc`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/boot`, `/root`, `/var/run`, `/var/log`) and home dotdirs (`.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.config/gcloud`, `.docker`, `.kube`). Symlinks are resolved before checking.
- **Google API key moved to header**: The Google embedding provider now sends the API key via the `x-goog-api-key` header instead of a URL query parameter, preventing credential exposure in logs and proxies.
- **Error response truncation**: All embedding providers now truncate error response bodies to 500 characters, preventing reflection of potentially sensitive data from misconfigured or malicious endpoints.
- **Config and eval loading hardening**: File-specific parse/shape errors, knowledge-base/include path rebasing fixes, and malformed eval summary coverage (#92).
- **Command and indexer diagnostics**: Surface command file read failures and warn-level cache recovery details for corrupted persisted state (#92).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-22

### Changed
- **Release metadata alignment**: Reconciled the post-`v0.8.0` shipped delta so the changelog and release metadata match the fixes that landed after the `v0.8.0` tag.

### Fixed
- **Atomic file-hash cache writes**: `Indexer.atomicWriteSync()` now recreates missing parent directories before writing `file-hashes.json.tmp`, preventing `ENOENT` crashes after the index directory has been removed.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Git worktree fallback and reuse**: Fresh git worktrees now inherit the main repository's project-scoped `.opencode` config and index when no local worktree state exists, including matching eval-path and knowledge-base handling.
- **Apex semantic parsing**: Added tree-sitter-based semantic chunking for Salesforce Apex source files (`.cls` and `.trigger`) via the [`tree-sitter-sfapex`](https://github.com/aheber/tree-sitter-sfapex) grammar. Recognizes class, interface, enum, method, constructor, and trigger declarations with leading JavaDoc-style block comments attached to their target chunks. Anonymous Apex (`.apex`), SOQL, and SOSL standalone files are out of scope.
- **Apex call graph extraction**: Method invocations, constructor calls (`new MyClass(...)`), and instance/static method calls are extracted for the `call_graph` tool. Apex is case-insensitive at the language level, so callee names are normalized to lowercase during extraction (matching the existing PHP behavior). Apex has no imports — namespaces are referenced via fully qualified names — so no `Import` edges are produced.
- **Zig language support**: Added tree-sitter semantic parsing, file discovery, and call-graph extraction for `.zig` files.
- **New slash commands**: Added `/peek` for lightweight location-first discovery and `/reindex` as a full rebuild shortcut.

### Changed
- **Ollama oversized-input handling**: Built-in Ollama embeddings now use pooled multi-part requests, broader context-length detection, and progressive retry/backoff behavior for oversized inputs.
- **Release documentation and support guidance**: Aligned maintainer guidance, support policy, and release workflow docs with the protected-branch release process used for `v0.8.0`.

### Fixed
- **Index reset and cleanup hardening**: Fixed shared/global rebuild flows, SQLite corruption recovery, stale chunk ownership cleanup, and related rebuild-state edge cases across project and worktree setups.
- **Windows build and test reliability**: Fixed Windows-native build/test failures with explicit database/indexer cleanup, portable path handling, and cross-platform native pretest scripting.
- **Database close lifecycle**: Hardened `Database.close()` so use-after-close fails fast instead of silently swapping to an in-memory SQLite connection.
- **Semantic search and rebuild cleanup**: Restored identifier fallback in semantic search and rebuilt cleanup paths from SQLite-backed state without relying on unsafe native remove flows.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Knowledge base support**: Added `add_knowledge_base`, `list_knowledge_bases`, and `remove_knowledge_base` tools to manage external document folders indexed alongside the project
- **Reranking with SiliconFlow**: Added `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` reranking support via SiliconFlow API for improved search result quality
- **Routing hints for local discovery**: Added dynamic routing hints so local search can steer retrieval toward more relevant code paths before semantic reranking
- **TXT/HTML file support**: Added `*.txt`, `*.html`, `*.htm` to default include patterns for document indexing
- **Config merging**: Global and project configs are now merged, allowing shared provider settings at global level and knowledge base paths at project level
- **Hidden file exclusion**: Files and folders starting with `.` are now excluded from indexing and file watching
- **Build folder exclusion**: Folders containing "build" in their name (e.g., `build`, `mingwBuildDebug`) are now excluded from indexing and file watching
- **additionalInclude config**: Added new config option to extend default file patterns without replacing them
- **Eval diversity quality gates**: Added raw and distinct top-k diversity metrics, budgets, and regression coverage for eval runs and reranker benchmarking

### Changed
- **Default verbose=false**: Changed `/index` command default to `verbose=false` to reduce token consumption
- **Dependency hardening**: Added targeted npm overrides and refreshed lockfile resolution to keep vulnerable transitive packages patched in release builds

### Fixed
- **Knowledge base refresh behavior**: Adding or removing knowledge bases now rebuilds the shared in-memory indexer immediately instead of requiring a restart
- **Watcher-triggered reindexing**: Restored automatic reindexing on file changes so watched projects and attached knowledge bases stay current during a live session
- **Parser and call-graph stability**: Fixed recursion-limit and segmentation-fault regressions, removed unsupported parent traversal paths, and improved PHP method-call extraction reliability
- **Plugin/runtime packaging**: Kept `@opencode-ai/plugin` available at runtime by shipping it as a dependency instead of relying on dev-only installation
- **Eval workflow rate limiting**: Throttled GitHub Models quality runs to avoid rate-limit failures in the release verification pipeline

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Custom provider batch caps**: Added `customProvider.maxBatchSize` / `max_batch_size` support so OpenAI-compatible embedding servers can cap inputs per `/embeddings` request
- **Environment placeholders in config**: Added `{env:VAR_NAME}` placeholder support for string config values so secrets and endpoints can be supplied from the environment instead of committed files

### Changed
- **Release documentation alignment**: Updated release metadata to publish the post-`v0.6.0` config improvements as `v0.6.1`

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Evaluation harness**: First-class eval CLI, golden datasets, budgets, compare mode, run artifacts, and smoke/quality workflows for measuring retrieval quality over time
- **Implementation lookup workflow**: Added a dedicated definition/implementation retrieval path across the CLI, plugin tools, MCP server, indexer, and tests for faster code lookup by intent
- **Cross-repo benchmarking**: Added a benchmark runner with ripgrep and ast-grep baselines plus reproducible benchmarking documentation and golden datasets for external repos
- **Release automation guardrails**: Added Release Drafter automation and CI enforcement for release-category and semver labels on pull requests
- **Contributor language-support guide**: Added an agent-ready guide for extending semantic parsing and call-graph support to new languages
- **PHP language support**: Added semantic parsing, chunking, and call-graph extraction for PHP, including fixtures and tests for constructors, imports, method calls, and simple calls

### Changed
- **Evaluation CI strategy**: Split the default GitHub Models quality gate from explicit external-provider budget checks and documented the active CI budget paths
- **Documentation refresh**: Reorganized contributor and maintenance docs, expanded evaluation and benchmarking guidance, and updated README benchmark snapshots and workflow references

### Fixed
- **Release Drafter permissions**: Restored draft-release updates so release automation can keep draft notes current
- **Eval/CI correctness**: Closed CI gating gaps, normalized baseline paths, and pinned the Rust toolchain action input used by CI
- **Benchmark auditability**: Fixed scoped ast-grep metric accounting and dataset/result mutability issues in the benchmark runner and reporting flow
- **Supply-chain hardening**: Tightened dependency and repository security posture, including stronger git/worktree handling coverage in tests
- **Native test reliability**: `test:run` and `test:coverage` now rebuild the native module first so newly added parser/call-graph language support is exercised against a current binary during release verification

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Call graph extraction and query**: Tree-sitter query-based extraction of function calls, method calls, constructors, and imports across 5 languages (TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust)
- **`call_graph` tool**: Query callers or callees of any function/method with branch-aware filtering
- **DB schema v2**: `symbols`, `call_edges`, and `branch_symbols` tables with full CRUD, GC, and batch operations
- **Same-file call resolution**: Automatically resolves call edges to symbols defined in the same file during indexing
- **`/call-graph` slash command**: Added command support for call graph workflows

### Changed
- **Documentation updates**: Expanded README, CHANGELOG, and skill guide to document call graph usage and behavior

### Fixed
- **Missing `call_graph` export**: The `call_graph` tool was not exported from the plugin entry point — now available to OpenCode users
- **JavaScript call extraction routing**: JavaScript now uses a dedicated query file instead of TypeScript query routing
- **Caller output context**: Caller results now include caller symbol/file context for clearer navigation
- **Call graph consistency/integrity**: Improved branch filtering and database integrity handling for call graph data

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Custom embedding provider**: Support for any OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint (`custom` provider with `baseUrl`, `model`, `dimensions` config). Works with llama.cpp, vLLM, text-embeddings-inference, LiteLLM, etc.

### Fixed
- **Critical: infinite recursion on stale lock file**: When a stale `indexing.lock` existed from a crashed session, `initialize()` entered infinite recursion via `recoverFromInterruptedIndexing()` → `healthCheck()` → `ensureInitialized()` → `initialize()`, causing 70GB+ memory usage and OOM. Recovery now runs after store/database initialization.
- **Relative path storage**: Index now stores relative paths for project portability. Detects and warns about legacy absolute-path indexes.
- **MCP status prompt**: Removed empty args schema from status prompt that caused validation errors

### Changed
- **Changelog and README**: Fixed bullet formatting, added platform support table

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **MCP server**: Standalone MCP server (`opencode-codebase-index-mcp` CLI) exposing all 8 tools and 4 prompts over stdio transport, enabling integration with Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf
- **Crash-safe indexing**: Lock file and atomic writes prevent index corruption from interrupted indexing sessions, with automatic recovery on next run
- **Git worktree support**: Branch detection now works correctly in git worktrees by resolving `.git` file pointers to the actual git directory
- **Index metadata contract**: Stores embedding provider, model, and dimensions in the database; blocks searches against incompatible indexes with clear error messages and `force=true` rebuild instructions
- **Google `gemini-embedding-001` model**: Support for Google's latest embedding model with Matryoshka truncation (3072D → 1536D) and task-specific embeddings (`CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY` / `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`)
- **Google batch embedding**: Batch requests up to 20 texts per API call via `batchEmbedContents` endpoint
- **Compatibility warnings**: Provider mismatch (same model + dimensions) now logs a warning instead of forcing a rebuild
- **Windows support**: Native binaries now build on Windows MSVC across all 5 platform targets (macOS x86/ARM, Linux x86/ARM, Windows x86)

### Changed
- **Embedding API split**: `embed()` replaced by `embedQuery()` and `embedDocument()` to support task-specific embeddings (Google)
- **Type-safe embedding models**: `EMBEDDING_MODELS` constant as single source of truth; `EmbeddingProvider`, `EmbeddingModelName`, and related types derived at compile time
- **Google default model**: Updated from deprecated `text-embedding-004` to `text-embedding-005`
- **Tool formatting**: Extracted all formatting functions from `src/tools/index.ts` to `src/tools/utils.ts`
- **Exhaustive provider check**: `createEmbeddingProvider` uses `never` exhaustive check instead of default branch
- **ESM compatibility**: Build config adds `createRequire` shim for ESM entry points

### Fixed
- **SQLite bind parameter limit**: `get_missing_embeddings` and `get_embeddings_batch` now batch `IN (...)` queries to stay under `SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER` (999) — fixes crash on large codebases (thanks @zb1749)
- **Google embedding API endpoints**: Corrected single and batch request URLs
- **Index compatibility on force rebuild**: `clearIndex()` now deletes stale index metadata so provider changes take effect
- **Search/findSimilar initialization**: Both now call `ensureInitialized()` before compatibility check
- **Windows MSVC build**: Disabled usearch `simsimd` feature on Windows — MSVC lacks `_mm512_reduce_add_ph` intrinsic. Pinned usearch to 2.23.0 to avoid 2.24.0 `MAP_FAILED` regression. Committed `Cargo.lock` for reproducible CI builds.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-01-19

### Added
- **`requireProjectMarker` config option**: Prevents plugin from hanging when opened in non-project directories like home. When `true` (default), requires a project marker (`.git`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.) to enable file watching and auto-indexing.

### Fixed
- Plugin no longer hangs when OpenCode is opened in home directory or other large non-project directories

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-18

### Added
- **`find_similar` tool**: Find code similar to a given snippet for duplicate detection, pattern discovery, and refactoring prep. Paste code and find semantically similar implementations elsewhere in the codebase.
- **`codebase_peek` tool**: Token-efficient semantic search returning metadata only (file, line, name, type) without code content. Saves ~90% tokens compared to `codebase_search` for discovery workflows.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-01-18

### Fixed
- Rust code formatting (cargo fmt)
- CI publish workflow: use Node 24 + npm OIDC trusted publishing (no token required)

## [0.3.1] - 2025-01-18

### Added
- **Query embedding cache**: LRU cache (100 entries, 5min TTL) avoids redundant API calls for repeated searches
- **Query similarity matching**: Reuses cached embeddings for similar queries (Jaccard similarity ≥0.85)
- **Batch metadata lookup**: `VectorStore.getMetadata()` and `getMetadataBatch()` for efficient chunk retrieval
- **Parse timing metrics**: Tracks `parseMs` for tree-sitter parsing duration
- **Query cache stats**: Separate tracking for exact hits, similar hits, and misses

### Changed
- BM25 keyword search now uses `getMetadataBatch()` - O(n) instead of O(total) for result metadata lookup

### Fixed
- Remove console output from Logger (was leaking to stdout)
- Record embedding API metrics for search queries (previously only tracked during indexing)
- Record embedding API metrics during batch retries
